### Why I created this app?
Well I just watched from a YouTube Tutorial which sounds like a tutorial hell thingy yet that's where most of use come from tho and there are lots of features will be available in the future and also as I observed that:

### `Background of the Study`

Some Students are trying to take a moment in every events yet they can't have afford to access to it despite of the price and also the printing and release of the photos after the event was taking too long and it takes 2 - 4 days approximately and even students can't customize their photos before it print and keep as thier souviener

### `Target Audience`

Anyone and mostly Students even instructors who want to set-up the photobooth right at the computer with camera or even fingertips so they can keep the memories as they enjoy with

### Why FOSS?
Well that was my idea to go to especially when it comes to these stuff some make it proprietary, but we don't blame them because that's what they want tho so mine was different but yeah, when it comes to monetization I can accept PayPal and GCash to continue this work and other projects
